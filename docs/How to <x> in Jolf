# How to <x> in Jolf
This is a FAQ on how to do stuff in Jolf.

## How do I check if a string has a character in it?
Use the ` h`as function of a string:

     h(string)(character)
     
Example: Does the input string have a space?

    (space)hi'(space)

## If statements?

No, not really. But most code can be re-worked with a condition choose statement, `?abc`, which is essentially `if a then b else c`. It is literally `a?b:c`.

Example: If the input is truthy, then return 1. Otherwise, return 0.

    ?j10

## How do I make the first character of a string uppercase?

You can make the `n`th character of a string uppercase with `py(string)n`.
