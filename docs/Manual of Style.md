You might be thinking _whaaaaat_ Jolf has a MANUAL OF STYLE!? Well, yeah. Don't freak out, it's not a lot: just a few rules. It makes code more "readable". (Disregard these rules if you are golfing.)

# On input

Each input has a different semantic meaning. `i` and `I` are used for string inputs _without_ quotes; `j` and `J` are used for numeric input; `x` and `X` are used for eval'd input (as JS; use for array/strings/regex literals); and `k` and `K` are arrays without `[` and `]`. However, the use of x` and `X` are preffered over the use of `k` and `K`.

# On identation
