# 2. Commands
This is an index of the commands.
(One can form a two-byte command by prefixing an instruction with a tilde (`~`).)

 * ` ` - takes the next character `C` and another argument `A` and executes `A[C]` as a function.
 * `!` - directly transpiles to `} else if(`.
 * `"` - begins string literal; writes characters to compiled code (surrounded by quotes) until another unescaped `"` is met. If a `'` is met, close the previous string and begin a new string. `%` acts as string interpolation, as such: `"Hello, %!"5 => "Hello, 5!"`
 * `#` - converts `a` to hexadecimal.
 * `$` - begin function literal; writes characters to compiled code as is, until another unescaped `$` is met
 * `%` - takes arguments `a` and `b`, and
   * `string, character` - removes all instances of `b` from `a`.
   * `array, anything` - removes all instances of `b` from `a`.
   * `number, number` - `a % b`.
 * `&` - takes the boolean conjunction of two arguments (`a && b`).
 * `'` - captures next character as a string.
 * `(` - [“`(` terminates the program and kills your computer”](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/25961158#25961158)
 * `)` - transpiles to `){` (closes control structure).
 * `*` - multiplies 2 arguments
   * `number, number` - multiplies the two numbers
   * `string, number` (&) - repeats `string` `number` times
   * `array, number` - creates a 2D array of length `number` that contains `array` as all of its members
 * `+` - adds 2 arguments, according to their types:
   * `number, number` - adds the two numbers
   * `anything, string` or `string, anything` - returns `string` concatted with `anything` (preserving order)
   * `array, array` - concats the two arrays
   * `non array, array` - Puts `non array` at the beginning of `array`
   * `array, non array` - pushes `non array` to `array`
   * `set, set` - the set union of the two sets
 * `,` - converts `a` to a boolean value (`!!a`).
 * `-` - subtracts 2 arguments, according to their types:
   * `number, number` - subtraction.
   * `string, anything` - converts the latter to a string and replaces all isntances of it in `string` with nothing, i.e. deletion.
   * `array, anything` - filters all instances of `anything` out of `array`.
 * `.` - takes 2 arguments `O` and `p` and returns `O[p]`; if `O[p]` is undefined, returns `window[O][p]`; if _that_ is undefined, returns 42.
 * `/` - takes 2 arguments `A` and `B` and returns `A/B`
 * digits `0-9` - that number.
 * `:` - begin character literal; writes the next character to compiled code as is. (NOTE: WILL BE CHANGED!!)
 * `;` - takes two arguments and literally does nothing. So, `+;123 => add(1,2,3)`. (NOTE: MAY CHANGE. USE MULTIPLE OPERATORS WHEN POSSIBLE. BUGGY BEHAVIOUR WHEN OTHER FUNCTIONS ARE USED IN PLACE OF ARGUMENTS.)
 * `&lt;` - takes 2 arguments `A` and `B` and returns `A &lt; B` (JS behaviour).
 * `=` - takes 2 arguments `A` and `B` and returns `A == B`.
 * `&gt;` - takes 2 arguments `A` and `B` and returns `A > B` (JS behaviour).
 * `?` - ternary if, consumes 3 arguments `c`, `a`, and `b`. Roughly equivalent to `c?a:b`. (Warning: evaluates `a` and `b`. Be wary with use in recursive functions. To be fixed, soon.)
 * `@` - returns the character code of the next character in the source code.
 * `A` - takes 3 arguments `r`, `s`, and `t`; replaces each character in `s` found in `r` with the respective character found in `t`.
 * `B` - takes 1 argument `N` and converts it to binary as a string (equiv. `(N).toString(2)`).
 * `C` - takes 2 arguments `A` and `B` and parses the string `A` as an integer in base `B` (equiv. `parseInt(A,B)`).
 * `D` - begins a function declaration, beginning with `function(H,S,n){`.
 * `E` - the empty string `""`.
 * `F` - returns the "first" property of 1 argument. Literally equivalent to `a[0]`. 
 * `O` - takes the product of 1 argument, depending on its type:
   * `array` - takes the product of the array
 * `P` - takes 1 argument `A` and returns `Number(A)` (converts all to number, if possible) (conversion an array into a number, as in `[1,2,3,1,0,2] => 123102`)
 * `Q` - squares 1 argument `S`, according to its type:
   * `number` - multiplies it by itself
   * `array` - takes the length of the array `N` and returns an array containing `N` copies of itself
   * `string` - TBA
 * `T` - takes 2 arguments `F` and `s`; surrounds `F` expression (after compilation) with quotes and evaluates that action `F` every `s` milliseconds
 * `R` - takes 2 arguments `F` and `s`; runs `F` after `s` milliseconds
 * `V` - takes 1 argument `S` and is the value `V` of `S`; if `S` is a number, returns `S`'s parity
 * `^` - takes 2 arguments `A` and `B` and retursn `A^B` (exponentiation) (behaviour TBA)
 * `_` - negates 1 argument, according to its type:
   * `string` or `array` or `set` - reverses the entity
   * `number` - negates the entity
 * `a` - outputs (alerts/writes) 1 argument
 * `b` - takes an integer `N` and a base `b` and returns `(N).toString(b)`; when `b = 1`, this is equal to a string of length `N` filled with `#`s.
 * `c` - writes 1 argument to the log (`console.log` at the moment)
 * `e` - takes 1 argument `S` and evaluates it as a new Jolf program; returns nothing at the moment
 * `f` - takes 2 arguments `F` and `R` as a function and takes the array `R` as its commands.
 * `p` - takes 3 arguments `a`, `b`, and `s` and creates a range `[a,b)` with a step `s`
 * `r` - takes 2 arguments `a` and `b` and creates a range `[a,b)` (inclusive of `a` and exclusive of `b`)
 * `u` - takes 1 argument
   * `array` or `set` - returns the sum of the entity
   * `string` - behaviour TBA
   * `number` - takes the digit sum of the number (e.g. `u(140) = 1 + 4 + 0 = 5`)
 * `v` - takes 2 arguments `S` and `V`; sets the value of variable `S` to `V` and creates `S` if nonexistant (returns `V`)
 * `z` - takes 1 argument and returns a range `[1,a]`
 * `~i` - takes 1 argument and returns that argument (the identity function)
 * `0-9` - that number
 * `q` - writes the source code's reference to the the compiled code
 * `i` and `I` - receive string input from `prompt`
 * `j` and `J` - receive numeric input from `prompt`
 * `E` - the empty string `""`
 * `Y` - the empty array `[]`
 * `~e` - Euler's number approx `2.718281828459045`
 * `~p` - &pi; approx `3.141592`
 * `~P` - &varphi;, `(1+sqrt[5])/2`
 * `~A` - writes `Array` to the compiled code
 * `~M` - writes `Math` to the compiled code
 * `~N` - writes `Number` to the compiled code
 * `~S` - writes `String` to the compiled code
 * `~p` - writes `prototype` to the compiled code
 * `~0` - Infinity
 * `~s` - writes `Set` to the compiled code
 * `~N`, for `N in [1,2,3,4]` - `10^(N+1)`
 * `'` - character literal; writes next character to compiled code (surrounded by quotes)
 * `[` - begin array parsing (separated by commas)
 * `` ` `` - forces an argument check
 * `\b` (hex 08) - prevents auto output
 * `x` - quit parsing of expression
