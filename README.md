# Jolf
Jolf is a prefix golfing language. It runs and compiles to JavaScript. Keep in mind that it is incomplete, and the commands are subject to change or modification in behaviour. Jolf is heavily inspired by [Pyth](https://github.com/isaacg1/pyth), and also draws inspiration from [the O language](https://github.com/phase/o).
